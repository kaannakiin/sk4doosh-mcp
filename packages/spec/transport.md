# Transport and OAuth 2.1

> Status: **normative** — validated by two independent implementations (the ASP.NET T1-T15 and Nest N1-N6 / G1-G2 matrices, plus `sdks/nestjs/samples/agent-client` against both demos).

Defines what sk-mcp adds on top of the Streamable HTTP transport: a `tools/list_changed` notification when the catalog changes, and RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata (PRM) with 401 decoration. Session management, Origin/CORS/TLS, and authorization itself (whether auth is required) are the **host's** design — ASP.NET and Express already offer first-class idioms for those; sk-mcp does not wrap them and only adds the two things that have no idiom.

## Scope

The complete surface sk-mcp adds to the transport layer:

1. `tools/list_changed` fan-out, bound to catalog reload.
2. `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource{mcpPath}` — the RFC 9728 PRM document, when `ResourceServer.Metadata` is configured.
3. `resource_metadata` decoration in the `WWW-Authenticate` header of 401 responses (without touching the host's own 401 body or its existing challenge parameters).
4. The audience rule (RFC 8707) — the SDK does not perform validation; it states what the host must put into its `TokenValidationParameters`/verifier.

sk-mcp MUST **never** set up `AddAuthentication`/`AddMcp` or an equivalent auth pipeline; enforcement is always whatever mechanism the host already has (JwtBearer plus `.RequireAuthorization()`, custom middleware, or nothing).

## Session mode

Session mode stays at the transport layer's own default; sk-mcp adds no separate knob.

- **.NET:** `HttpServerTransportOptions.SessionMode` defaults to `Stateless` (the 2026-07-28 protocol, no `Mcp-Session-Id`). A host that wants otherwise changes it with `services.Configure<HttpServerTransportOptions>(o => o.SessionMode = StatefulForInitializeClients)` — ASP.NET's own idiom, a surface sk-mcp does not wrap.
- **Nest:** because there is no counterpart surface (Express has no `HttpServerTransportOptions` equivalent), sk-mcp offers a legitimate knob here: `options.transport.sessionMode: "stateless" | "stateful"`. `stateless` → `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`, `enableJsonResponse: true`, a new `McpServer` per request; `stateful` → `randomUUID`, `enableJsonResponse: false`, `keepAliveMs: 30_000`, with sessions held in `SkMcpSessionStore` (`idleTimeoutMs: 2h`, `maxIdleSessions: 10_000` — mirroring the .NET defaults), and GET/DELETE routed to the stored session via `mcp-session-id`; in `stateless` mode GET/DELETE return `405`.

In stateless mode there is no server→client notification mechanism; `listChanged` is a no-op there **with no error at all** (no session is listening).

## `listChanged` semantics

sk-mcp's three meta-tools (`search_tools`, `load_tool`, `invoke_tool`) do **not** change when the catalog changes — the backend endpoint catalog behind them does. So what carries the change is not the meta-tool list itself but each meta-tool's `_meta` field:

- The `tools.listChanged` capability is always declared `true`.
- Every meta-tool definition is stamped with `_meta["sk-mcp/catalogGeneration"]` — the catalog snapshot's generation counter ([caching.md](caching.md), "Invalidation" — `ISkMcpCatalogChangeSource.ReloadAsync` → `Generation++`).
- The notification fires **only** on catalog reload; authorization-invalidation operations (`InvalidateCallerAsync` and friends) do not change the catalog and therefore MUST NOT trigger `listChanged`. The payload a `tools/list` call returns genuinely differs when the generation changes (the `_meta` stamp increments) — the notification is honest, not an empty "something changed" signal.

**The .NET mechanism:** the `McpServerOptions.ToolCollection.Changed` event triggers the SDK's own `SendListChangedNotificationAsync` (covering both the pre-SEP-2575 broadcast and the 2026-07-28 `subscriptions/listen` routing). sk-mcp does not build its own session registry — commandeering the SDK's single-slot `RunSessionHandler`/`ConfigureSessionOptions` would mean rewriting the fan-out the SDK already performs. A single `NotifyChanged()` call reaches every live session in every mode; in stateless mode, with no listener, nothing happens silently.

**The Nest mechanism:** while `registerSkMcpTools` registers the three meta-tools it stamps the generation into `_meta` and subscribes to catalog changes; on a change the three tools' `_meta` are re-stamped and **one** `listChanged` is sent to that session. Stamping is done by assigning `_meta` directly rather than through `RegisteredTool.update()`: `update()` emits its own notification on every call, so three tools would produce three notifications, and the rule is one notification per session. The subscription is released when the session's server closes. The host's manual path also remains: `SkMcpStreamableHttp.notifyToolListChanged()` calls `server.sendToolListChanged()` for every session in the registry (meaningful in stateful mode; with no sessions alive in stateless mode it has no effect).

**Known limit (documented):** on the .NET side, if the host uses its own `ConfigureSessionOptions` to create a per-session clone of the tool collection and that clone does not share sk-mcp's collection reference, the fan-out will not reach that session. In a multi-instance deployment the notification reaches only the sessions in the local process — cross-instance fan-out is outside sk-mcp's scope.

## Protected Resource Metadata (PRM)

When `ResourceServer.Metadata` is configured (if the host does not set it, the PRM endpoint is never published and no decoration is ever added):

- **Path:** `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource{mcpPath}`, where `mcpPath` is the path of the endpoint sk-mcp is mapped to (for `/mcp`, therefore, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`), following RFC 9728's path-prefix rule.
- **Required fields:** `resource` and `authorization_servers` (at least one element) — without both, startup validation fails, and PRM is never published incomplete.
- **Access:** the endpoint is fully anonymous; it is the first step of the authentication flow and cannot itself be protected.
- **Caching:** `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`.
- **`ChallengeUri`** is derived by prefixing `Metadata.Resource` with the `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` path segment; it is **not** derived from the incoming request (Host header, proxy) — for deployments behind a proxy this is explicitly `Metadata.Resource` itself, never implicit.

## The 401 rule — merging

sk-mcp's transport layer adds `resource_metadata="<ChallengeUri>"` to the `WWW-Authenticate` header of every `401` response on the protected path (plus `scope="..."` when present), **but**:

- If the host already wrote a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer ...` (for example ASP.NET JwtBearer's own `error="invalid_token"` challenge), sk-mcp MUST NOT add a new header — it **merges** the `resource_metadata` parameter into the single existing `Bearer` value. The rationale: the `WWW-Authenticate` parsers on both the .NET and TS sides (`ParseWwwAuthenticateParameters`, `extractWWWAuthenticateParams`) expect one `Bearer` value, and a second header may stay invisible to clients.
- If the host wrote no `WWW-Authenticate` at all (for example custom middleware, such as the real backend's `JwtAuthenticationMiddleware`), sk-mcp adds the `Bearer resource_metadata="..."` header **from scratch**.
- **The host's 401 body MUST NEVER be modified** — decoration is at the header level only; body leak-prevention rules are defined in [error-mapping.md](error-mapping.md), and PRM decoration is independent of them.
- If the host's own SDK `AddMcp`/`mcpAuthMetadataRouter` already adds `resource_metadata`, sk-mcp **sees it and does not touch it** — whichever service runs first serves PRM, and there is no double write.

## Audience (RFC 8707)

sk-mcp does **not** perform audience validation — it states what value the host must put into the `TokenValidationParameters`/verifier mechanism it already has: `ValidAudience` (or its equivalent) MUST be **the same** as `ResourceServer.Metadata.Resource`. RFC 8707 requires the authorization server issuing the token to write that `resource` value into the `aud` claim; the host's token validator (including a custom validator) must accept that audience, or add sk-mcp's MCP URL to its `ValidAudiences` list.

## Scope delegation

Scope is fully **delegated** to the host: `ScopesSupported` is passed through into the PRM document as-is, and sk-mcp does not inspect, validate or enforce scope contents. Which scope is required for which operation is a decision of the backend's own authorization layer (policy, guard) — and [visibility.md](visibility.md)'s T1 declarative tier already reads those decisions.

On the Nest side the granular test-to-concept mapping lives in `transport.spec.ts` itself (an implementation detail); in both SDKs the full OAuth round trip is validated not inside the SDK's own test suite but against the running demo with [sdks/nestjs/samples/agent-client](../../sdks/nestjs/samples/agent-client) — which on the dotnet side holds **in addition to** T5's TestServer run inside xunit, not instead of it.

## The demo authorization server

An in-repo authorization server with no Docker and no external service (`sdks/dotnet/samples/DemoAuthServer/`; on the Nest side the SDK's own `mcpAuthRouter` plus an in-memory provider) exists so that all three exit criteria (DemoApi, the xunit `TestServer`, the Nest demo) can run the OAuth 2.1 flow (DCR, mandatory PKCE S256, authorization code, refresh) end to end inside a single process. An external authorization server (Keycloak, Duende, Auth0) is only documented as "this is how you connect in production" and does not enter the repository.
