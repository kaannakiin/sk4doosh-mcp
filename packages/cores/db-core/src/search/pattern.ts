 * Guard: bounded dynamic programming, never a constructed RegExp — the pattern
 * is agent input and a translated one backtracks catastrophically on `%a%a%a…`.
 * The same reason [file-core listing.ts](../../../file-core/src/listing.ts)
 * matches globs this way. Both sides are folded, so a pattern typed without
 * diacritics still finds the name that carries them.
